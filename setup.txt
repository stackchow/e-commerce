To serve the frontend locally
cd frontend/

npm install --global yarn (If you don't have yarn installed on your system)

yarn install (To install all dependencies)

yarn start (To start the frontend server)

The frontend would be hosted on http://localhost:3000



To run backend server
cd backend/

Note: Make sure you have the .env(./config) files configured

Install node and npm(if you don't have them installed)

npm install (To install all dependencies)

npm run start (To start the backend server) or
    npm run dev (This uses nodemon so you don't need to restart server when you make changes to the backend)

The Backend server would be running on PORT 8000


To run socket server
cd socket/ 

npm install

npm run start


With .env files properly setup, the Web app should work efficiently,  kindly open an issue if there's any.
